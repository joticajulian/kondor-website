# Koinos contracts AS

## Installation

Run `yarn install` to install the required dependencies.

Create a copy of `env.example`, rename it to `.env`, and update its values as explained in the file. This will be needed for the deployment and interaction with the contracts.

## Token Contract

This is a contract to deploy any type of token. Go to `contracts/token/assembly/Token.ts` to update `_name`, `_symbol`, and `_decimals` with your preferred values.

Run:

```
yarn build:token
```

This will make a precompilation in the `contracts/token/build` folder, and it will build the final compilation in `contracts/token/build/release/contract.wasm`.

Finally deploy the contract:

```
yarn deploy:token
```

Now you can consult a blockexplorer, like koinosblocks.com to check your deployment

## Verify code

In order to verify the authenticity of the deployed code, this repo contains a Dockerfile to compile the code and get the wasm file with its corresponding sha256 identifier. Then these values can be compared with the code deployed in the blockchain to prove its authenticity.

Run docker and set in `CONTRACT` arg the contract you want to build:

```
docker build --no-cache --progress=plain --build-arg CONTRACT=token -t temp-image . && docker rmi temp-image
```

You should see at the end some info from the contract selected:

```
contract: token
file:     /contracts/contracts/token/build/release/contract.wasm
size:     25524 bytes (24.93 kB)
sha256:   c5c06834d91c20cf99ad63a6f1fc656407fb00620f917788dbe8b203adfc4696
```
